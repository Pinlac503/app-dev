## Why I Like It
The 2022 version brings the story to life with **raw emotion**, **haunting visuals**, and **powerful music**.  
It captures the **fear, desperation, and loss of humanity** that war brings themes that remain relevant even today.  
When compared to the **1930 film** and the **original book**, the new version feels more **immersive and tragic**, showing the same message through modern filmmaking.
